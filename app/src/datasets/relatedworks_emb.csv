Local Affine Multidimensional Projection, abstract: Multidimensional projection techniques have experienced many improvements lately, mainly regarding computational times and accuracy. However, existing methods do not yet provide flexible enough mechanisms for visualization-oriented fully interactive applications. This work presents a new multidimensional projection technique designed to be more flexible and versatile than other methods. This novel approach, called Local Affine Multidimensional Projection (LAMP), relies on orthogonal mapping theory to build accurate local transformations that can be dynamically modified according to user knowledge. The accuracy, flexibility, and computational efficiency of LAMP is confirmed by a comprehensive set of comparisons. LAMP’s versatility is exploited in an application which seeks to correlate data that, in principle, has no connection as well as in visual exploration of textual documents., authors: [{'name': 'Paulo Joia', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil'}, {'name': 'Fernando V.

Visual Analytics for Topic Model Optimization based on User-Steerable Speculative Execution, abstract: This paper introduces a visual analytics framework for optimizing topic models through user-steerable speculative execution. It presents an explainable, mixed-initiative topic modeling framework that integrates speculative execution into the algorithmic decision-making process, allowing users to preview the effects of their interventions before applying them.

Understanding Text Corpora with Multiple Facets, abstract: Text visualization becomes an increasingly more important research topic as the need to understand massive-scale textual information is proven to be imperative for many people and businesses. However, it is still very challenging to design effective visual metaphors to represent large corpora of text due to the unstructured and high-dimensional nature of text. In this paper, we propose a data model that can be used to represent most of the text corpora. Such a data model contains four basic types of facets: time, category, content (unstructured), and structured facet. To understand the corpus with such a data model, we develop a hybrid visualization by combining the trend graph with tag-clouds. We encode the four types of data facets with four separate visual dimensions. To help people discover evolutionary and correlation patterns, we also develop several visual interaction methods that allow people to interactively analyze text by one or more facets. Finally, we present two case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution in support of multi-faceted visual analysis of text corpora., authors: [{'name': 'Lei Shi', 'affiliation': 'IBM Research - China'}, {'name': 'Furu Wei', 'affiliation': 'IBM Research - China'}, {'name': 'Shixia Liu', 'affiliation': 'IBM Research - China'}, {'name': 'Li Tan', 'affiliation': 'IBM Research - China'}, {'name': 'Xiaoxiao Lian', 'affiliation': 'IBM Research - China'}, {'name': 'Michelle X.

Approximated and User Steerable tSNE for Progressive Visual Analytics, abstract: This paper introduces a controllable tSNE approximation (A-tSNE) to enable interactive data exploration by trading off speed and accuracy. It presents real-time visualization techniques, including a density-based solution and a Magic Lens to inspect the degree of approximation. This feedback allows users to decide on local refinements and steer the approximation level during analysis, demonstrating the technique's effectiveness for interactive data analysis., authors: [{'name': 'Nicola Pezzotti', 'affiliation': 'Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands'}, {'name': 'Boudewijn P.

Parallel Tag Clouds to Explore and Analyze Faceted Text Corpora, abstract: This paper introduces Parallel Tag Clouds (PTCs), a novel visualization technique for exploring differences among facets of large, metadata-rich text corpora. By combining elements from parallel coordinates and traditional tag clouds, PTCs provide rich overviews of document collections, highlighting regional and linguistic differences, particularly in the context of over 600,000 US Circuit Court decisions., authors: [{'name': 'Christopher Collins', 'affiliation': 'University of Toronto'}, {'name': 'Fernanda B.

Visual Abstraction and Ordering in Faceted Browsing of Text Collections, abstract: This paper reports on a visual support approach toward faceted browsing of a collection of documents based on a set of entities of interest to users. It proposes a multi-dimensional visualization as an alternative to the linear listing of focus items, enabling visual abstraction based on a combination of a conceptual structure and the structural equivalence of documents to deal with a large number of items and support prioritized, cross-facet comparisons., authors: [{'name': 'Vinhtuan Thai', 'affiliation': 'National University of Ireland, Galway'}, {'name': 'Pierre-Yves Rouille', 'affiliation': 'Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Cognitique'}, {'name': 'Siegfried Handschuh', 'affiliation': 'National University of Ireland, Galway'}], publicationVenue: ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, publicationDate: February 2012, keywords: ['Faceted browsing', 'text collections', 'visual exploration'], theoreticalFramework: The research is guided by the need for improved user experience in faceted browsing interfaces, particularly for text collections without clean metadata.

ConceptScope: Organizing and Visualizing Knowledge in Documents based on Domain Ontology, abstract: Current text visualization techniques typically provide overviews of document content and structure using intrinsic properties such as term frequencies, co-occurrences, and sentence structures. Such visualizations lack conceptual overviews incorporating domain-relevant knowledge, needed when examining documents such as research articles or technical reports. To address this shortcoming, we present ConceptScope, a technique that utilizes a domain ontology to represent the conceptual relationships in a document in the form of a Bubble Treemap visualization. Multiple coordinated views of document structure and concept hierarchy with text overviews further aid document analysis. ConceptScope facilitates exploration and comparison of single and multiple documents respectively. We demonstrate ConceptScope by visualizing research articles and transcripts of technical presentations in computer science. In a comparative study with DocuBurst, a popular document visualization tool, ConceptScope was found to be more informative in exploring and comparing domain-specific documents, but less so when it came to documents that spanned multiple disciplines., authors: [{'name': 'Xiaoyu Zhang', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, California'}, {'name': 'Senthil Chandrasegaran', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, Delft University of Technology, 2628 CE Delft, The Netherlands'}, {'name': 'Kwan-Liu Ma', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, California'}], publicationVenue: CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI ’21), publicationDate: May 8–13, 2021, keywords: ['Visualization', 'Ontology', 'Knowledge Representation'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the need for domain-specific knowledge representation in document visualization, leveraging ontologies to provide a structured and conceptual overview of document content., mainPoints: ['Introduction of ConceptScope, a novel text visualization technique.', 'Utilization of domain ontology for conceptual relationship representation.', 'Implementation of Bubble Treemap visualization for concept hierarchy.', 'Facilitation of document exploration and comparison through coordinated views.', ""Demonstration of ConceptScope's utility in computer science document visualization."", ""Comparative analysis with DocuBurst, highlighting ConceptScope's domain-specific advantages.""], results: ConceptScope was found to be more informative and effective in exploring and comparing domain-specific documents compared to DocuBurst, especially for documents within a single discipline.

Large Language Models Enable Few-Shot Clustering, abstract: This paper explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing semi-supervised text clustering with minimal expert feedback. It demonstrates that LLMs can significantly improve clustering by being incorporated at different stages: before clustering to improve input features, during clustering to provide constraints, and after clustering for post-correction. The study finds notable improvements in cluster quality when LLMs are used in the first two stages and highlights the potential for LLMs to balance cost and accuracy in clustering tasks., authors: [{'name': 'Vijay Viswanathan', 'affiliation': 'Carnegie Mellon University'}, {'name': 'Kiril Gashteovski', 'affiliation': 'NEC Laboratories Europe'}, {'name': 'Carolin Lawrence', 'affiliation': 'NEC Laboratories Europe'}, {'name': 'Tongshuang Wu', 'affiliation': 'Carnegie Mellon University'}, {'name': 'Graham Neubig', 'affiliation': 'Carnegie Mellon University, Inspired Cognition'}], publicationVenue: arXiv, publicationDate: 2 Jul 2023, keywords: ['Large Language Models', 'Few-Shot Clustering', 'Semi-Supervised Clustering', 'Text Clustering', 'LLM-Guided Clustering'], theoreticalFramework: The study is grounded in the theory of semi-supervised clustering, which posits that incorporating expert knowledge or feedback can guide the clustering process to better align with human intent., mainPoints: ['LLMs can significantly enhance semi-supervised text clustering with minimal expert input.', 'LLMs are effective at different stages of clustering: improving input features, providing clustering constraints, and post-clustering correction.', 'Incorporating LLMs early in the clustering process (before and during) yields the most significant improvements.', 'LLMs enable a trade-off between cost and accuracy, allowing for the production of desired clusters with reduced expert involvement.'], results: The study finds that LLMs consistently improve the quality of clusters across all datasets when used to enrich document representations or provide pairwise constraints.

Termite: Visualization Techniques for Assessing Textual Topic Models, abstract: Topic models aid analysis of text corpora by identifying latent topics based on co-occurring words. Real-world deployments of topic models often require intensive expert verification and model refinement. This paper presents Termite, a visual analysis tool for assessing topic model quality. Termite uses a tabular layout to promote comparison of terms both within and across latent topics. It introduces a novel saliency measure for selecting relevant terms and a seriation algorithm that reveals clustering structure and promotes the legibility of related terms. Through examples, it demonstrates how Termite allows analysts to identify coherent and significant themes., authors: [{'name': 'Jason Chuang', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University Computer Science Department'}, {'name': 'Christopher D.

Interactive Text Visualization with Text Variation Explorer, abstract: Digitalization is changing how research is carried out in all areas of science, including the humanities. This paper addresses the problem of interactive text visualization in the context of sociolinguistic language study by designing and developing a software tool called Text Variation Explorer (TVE) for sociolinguistic language study.

A New Evolving Tree for Text Document Clustering and Visualization, abstract: This paper introduces an evolving model, the Evolving Tree (ETree), as an alternative to the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for text document clustering and visualization. ETree forms a hierarchical tree structure where nodes can grow, and each leaf node represents a cluster of documents. The study demonstrates the application of ETree in clustering and visualizing articles from the Engineering Conference (ENCON) organized by Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS)., authors: [{'name': 'Wui Lee Chang', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak, Malaysia'}, {'name': 'Kai Meng Tay', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak, Malaysia'}, {'name': 'Chee Peng Lim', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Intelligent Systems Research, Deakin University, Geelong, Australia'}], publicationVenue: Soft Computing in Industrial Applications, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing 223, publicationDate: 2014, keywords: ['Evolving Tree', 'Text Document Clustering', 'Visualization', 'Self-Organizing Map', 'Online Learning'], theoreticalFramework: The study is grounded in the theory of unsupervised learning and clustering, particularly using neural network models like SOM and its limitations in online learning and pre-determined map size. ETree is proposed as an evolving system that addresses these limitations., mainPoints: ['Introduction of ETree as an alternative to SOM for text document clustering.', 'ETree supports online learning and does not require a pre-determined map size.', ""Experimental study using articles from the ENCON conference to demonstrate ETree's application."", ""Analysis of ETree's performance in clustering and visualization of text documents.""], results: The experimental results show that ETree can effectively cluster and visualize text documents, as demonstrated with the ENCON conference articles. The evolving feature of ETree allows for dynamic clustering without the need for re-training with new documents., applications: ['Text document clustering and visualization for academic conferences.', 'Decision support tool for conference organizers to analyze manuscripts and design conference tracks.', 'Potential applications in image and signal processing.'], additionalInformation: ['ETree addresses the limitations of SOM by supporting online learning and eliminating the need for a pre-determined map size.', 'Future work includes developing an ETree with dynamic child node settings and exploring other applications.'], methodology.dataCollection: Articles from the ENCON conference organized by Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) were used as the dataset for the experimental study., methodology.dataAnalysis: ETree's hierarchical tree structure was analyzed for its ability to cluster and visualize text documents based on their similarities.

Interactive Design of Multidimensional Data Projection Layout, abstract: Projection methods support effective visualizations of multidimensional data. Linear projections are an important subclass, as they allow for interactive visual exploration of the data space and feature sensitivity analysis. The user interaction is usually based on an iterative modification of the projection matrix elements, for example, by the use of a star coordinate widget. However, such interaction mechanisms become inefficient with increasing number of dimensions. We propose to adapt the projection matrix by allowing the user to directly operate on the projection domain. The desired configuration of the projection layout is obtained by adjusting the positions of (freely chosen) control points. The update of the projection matrix is performed according to the interactive modifications by computing a least-square solution of a linear equation system. Changes can be tracked easily using animation. We apply our method to classified multidimensional data and demonstrate that our approach allows for an intuitive and effective design of projections with desired properties like improved class segregation or reduced clutter., authors: [{'name': 'Vladimir Molchanov', 'affiliation': 'Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany'}, {'name': 'Lars Linsen', 'affiliation': 'Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany'}], publicationVenue: Eurographics Conference on Visualization (EuroVis) (2014) Short Papers, publicationDate: 2014, keywords: ['Projections', 'Multidimensional Data', 'Interactive Design', 'Visualization', 'Linear Projections', 'Least-Square Solution', 'Star Coordinates'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the theory and application of linear projections for multidimensional data visualization, emphasizing the need for interactive and intuitive methods for modifying projection layouts to achieve desired visualization properties., mainPoints: ['Linear projections are key for visualizing multidimensional data due to their simplicity and low computational costs.', 'Existing interaction mechanisms for modifying projections are inefficient for high-dimensional data.', 'A novel technique is proposed that allows users to directly manipulate the projection domain via control points to achieve desired projection layouts.', 'The technique uses a least-square solution to iteratively update the projection matrix based on user modifications.'], results: The proposed method allows for intuitive and effective design of projection layouts with improved properties such as class segregation and reduced clutter.

Steerable, Progressive Multidimensional Scaling, abstract: This paper introduces an extension to the spring model approach of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) that allows interactive exploration of large-scale datasets. The proposed system, MDSteer, employs hierarchical data structures and progressive layouts to enable users to steer the computation of MDS to areas of interest within datasets containing over one million points. This approach facilitates immediate exploration and focuses computational resources on selected areas for refinement., authors: [{'name': 'Matt Williams', 'affiliation': 'University of British Columbia'}, {'name': 'Tamara Munzner', 'affiliation': 'University of British Columbia'}], publicationVenue: IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2004, publicationDate: 2004, keywords: ['dimensionality reduction', 'multidimensional scaling', 'interaction techniques', 'data structures', 'clustering algorithms', 'graphs and networks'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the theory of dimensionality reduction, specifically focusing on Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) as a technique to represent high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional spaces. The work builds on existing MDS approaches, introducing steerability and progressive layout to enhance interactive exploration of large datasets., mainPoints: ['Introduction of a steerable MDS computation engine and visualization tool, MDSteer, for large-scale datasets.', 'Employment of hierarchical data structures and progressive layouts to enable interactive exploration and focus on areas of interest.', ""Demonstration of the system's capability to handle datasets with dimensionalities up to several hundred and cardinalities of over one million."", 'Presentation of both real and synthetic benchmark datasets to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach.'], results: MDSteer provides an immediate overview of the dataset structure, allowing users to begin exploring datasets of over 1 million nodes quickly. The system enables users to interactively select local regions of interest and refine these areas efficiently, demonstrating the ability to explore and steer computational resources to regions of interest for datasets significantly larger than those handled by previous work., applications: ['Interactive exploration of large-scale high-dimensional datasets.', 'Focused analysis of specific areas within large datasets, enabling efficient data exploration and discovery.'], additionalInformation: [""The system's performance and layout quality were compared against non-steerable approaches, showing that MDSteer allows for immediate and focused exploration without significantly increasing computation time or memory requirements."", 'Future work includes implementing more efficient nearest-neighbor finding techniques, exploring changes to the selection criteria for neighborhood and random sample sets, and developing a fully progressive algorithm for binning and layout.', 'The research highlights the importance of steerability in MDS for exploring huge datasets, providing a significant contribution to the field of information visualization and dimensionality reduction.'], methodology.dataCollection: The study uses both real-world datasets and common synthetic benchmark datasets with dimensionalities ranging from 3 to 300 and cardinalities of over one million points., methodology.dataAnalysis: The MDSteer algorithm iteratively alternates between layout stages, where a sub-selection of points are added to the set of active points, and binning stages, which organize currently unplaced points into separate spatial regions. This binning strategy allows users to focus the MDS computation on selected areas."

Embedding Comparator: Visualizing Differences in Global Structure and Local Neighborhoods via Small Multiples, abstract: Embeddings mapping high-dimensional discrete input to lower-dimensional continuous vector spaces have been widely adopted in machine learning applications as a way to capture domain semantics. The Embedding Comparator is an interactive system that presents a global comparison of embedding spaces alongside fine-grained inspection of local neighborhoods.

InterAxis: Steering Scatterplot Axes via Observation-Level Interaction, abstract: Scatterplots are effective visualization techniques for multidimensional data that use two (or three) axes to visualize data items as a point at its corresponding x and y Cartesian coordinates. Typically, each axis is bound to a single data attribute. Interactive exploration occurs by changing the data attributes bound to each of these axes. In this paper, we present InterAxis, a visual analytics technique to properly interpret, define, and change an axis in a user-driven manner. Users are given the ability to define and modify axes by dragging data items to either side of the x or y axes, from which the system computes a linear combination of data attributes and binds it to the axis., authors: [{'name': 'Hannah Kim', 'affiliation': 'Georgia Institute of Technology'}, {'name': 'Jaegul Choo', 'affiliation': 'Korea University'}, {'name': 'Haesun Park', 'affiliation': 'Georgia Institute of Technology'}, {'name': 'Alex Endert', 'affiliation': 'Georgia Institute of Technology'}], publicationVenue: IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, publicationDate: 25 Oct. 2015, keywords: ['Scatterplots', 'user interaction', 'model steering'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the principles of semantic interaction techniques, focusing on the tradeoff between direct manipulation of analytic model parameters and semantic interaction approaches that perform model steering through the inference of user actions., mainPoints: ['Introduction of InterAxis, a system for interactive steering of scatterplot axes.', 'Ability for users to define and modify axes through direct interaction with data points.', 'Use of linear combination of data attributes to compute new axes.', ""Demonstration of the system's utility through usage scenarios with real-world datasets.""], results: The system enables users to interactively explore and understand multidimensional data through user-driven axis definition and modification, facilitating the discovery of meaningful insights., applications: ['Visual analytics for multidimensional data exploration.', 'Interactive data exploration in domains such as vehicle shopping and crime data analysis.'], additionalInformation: ['The system is web-based, implemented using JavaScript and D3 toolkit.', 'Limitations include challenges with non-linear models and sparse data, with suggestions for future improvements.', 'Potential for future work includes enhancing scalability, supporting fine-tuning capabilities, and guiding users towards buried information.'], methodology.dataCollection: Usage of real-world datasets such as car data and crime data for demonstration., methodology.dataAnalysis: Computation of new axes through linear combination of data attributes based on user interaction."

Multi-Model Semantic Interaction for Text Analytics, abstract: Semantic interaction offers an intuitive communication mechanism between human users and complex statistical models. By shielding the users from manipulating model parameters, they focus instead on directly manipulating the spatialization, thus remaining in their cognitive zone. However, this technique is not inherently scalable past hundreds of text documents. To remedy this, we present the concept of multi-model semantic interaction, where semantic interactions can be used to steer multiple models at multiple levels of data scale, enabling users to tackle larger data problems. We also present an updated visualization pipeline model for generalized multi-model semantic interaction. To demonstrate multi-model semantic interaction, we introduce StarSPIRE, a visual text analytics prototype that transforms user interactions on documents into both small-scale display layout updates as well as large-scale relevancy-based document selection., authors: [{'name': 'Lauren Bradel', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Tech'}, {'name': 'Chris North', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Tech'}, {'name': 'Leanna House', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Tech'}, {'name': 'Scotland Leman', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Tech'}], publicationVenue: IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology 2014, publicationDate: November 9-14, Paris, France, keywords: ['Visual analytics', 'Semantic Interaction', 'Sensemaking', 'Text Analytics'], theoreticalFramework: The research is guided by the theoretical framework of semantic interaction within visual analytics, focusing on the cognitive processes of users during sensemaking tasks and how these can be supported by multi-model interactions., mainPoints: ['Introduction of multi-model semantic interaction to support text analytics on large datasets.', 'Presentation of an updated visualization pipeline for generalized multi-model semantic interaction.', 'Demonstration of the StarSPIRE prototype, implementing multi-model semantic interaction for unstructured text data.'], results: The multi-model semantic interaction approach enabled users to effectively engage in sensemaking tasks with large datasets, as demonstrated by the StarSPIRE prototype, which was tested on datasets up to 10,000 text documents., applications: ['Enhancing text analytics tools to support analysis of large-scale unstructured text datasets.', 'Improving the usability of visual analytics systems by allowing users to interactively steer multiple models.'], additionalInformation: ['The technique addresses scalability issues in semantic interaction by enabling steering of multiple models.', 'Future research directions include exploring additional models for retrieval and layout, and applying the technique to larger datasets and streaming data.', 'Key contributions include the concept of multi-model semantic interaction and the demonstration of its practical application through the StarSPIRE prototype.'], methodology.dataCollection: Use of unstructured text documents and user interactions as primary data sources., methodology.dataAnalysis: Analysis of user interactions to steer both display layout and relevancy-based document selection models."

TopicLens: Efficient Multi-Level Visual Topic Exploration of Large-Scale Document Collections, abstract: Topic modeling, which reveals underlying topics of a document corpus, has been actively adopted in visual analytics for large-scale document collections. However, due to its significant processing time and non-interactive nature, topic modeling has so far not been tightly integrated into a visual analytics workflow. TopicLens addresses this gap by proposing a novel interaction technique that allows a user to dynamically explore data through a lens interface where topic modeling and the corresponding 2D embedding are efficiently computed on the fly., authors: [{'name': 'Minjeong Kim', 'affiliation': 'Korea University'}, {'name': 'Kyeongpil Kang', 'affiliation': 'Korea University'}, {'name': 'Deokgun Park', 'affiliation': 'University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA'}, {'name': 'Jaegul Choo', 'affiliation': 'Korea University'}, {'name': 'Niklas Elmqvist', 'affiliation': 'University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA'}], publicationVenue: IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, publicationDate: January 2017, keywords: ['topic modeling', 'nonnegative matrix factorization', 't-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding', 'magic lens', 'text analytics'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the need for interactive visual analytics in the exploration of large-scale document collections, leveraging topic modeling techniques such as nonnegative matrix factorization and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding., mainPoints: ['Introduction of TopicLens, a novel interaction technique for real-time topic modeling within a visual analytics system.', 'Proposal of dynamic hierarchical rank-2 nonnegative matrix factorization (DH-NMF) for efficient topic modeling.', 'Development of guided approximate t-SNE for maintaining view consistency in 2D embedding.', 'Demonstration of TopicLens through a web-based visual analytics system.'], results: TopicLens enables real-time, interactive exploration of document collections, revealing finer-grained topical structures efficiently while maintaining view consistency., applications: ['Real-time visual analytics of large-scale document collections.', 'Interactive exploration of topics within specific areas of interest in a document corpus.'], additionalInformation: ['The study highlights the challenge of integrating computationally intensive topic modeling techniques into interactive visual analytics workflows.', 'Future research directions include exploring other computational and visualization methods within the dynamic lens interface.', 'The study contributes to the field by providing a novel approach to real-time topic modeling and visualization, enhancing the interactivity and efficiency of visual analytics systems.'], methodology.dataCollection: Use of large-scale document collections, including news articles and academic papers., methodology.dataAnalysis: Application of DH-NMF for topic modeling and guided approximate t-SNE for 2D embedding of documents."

TopicRefiner: Coherence-guided Steerable LDA for Visual Topic Enhancement, abstract: This paper presents a new Human-steerable Topic Modeling (HSTM) technique that extends LDA for extracting topics with better applicability and incorporates users' refinements into the Gibbs sampling to control LDA. It addresses the complexity of LDA and the challenge of selecting relevant objects in a vast corpus by designing a visual editing framework based on the coherence metric.

ConceptVector: Text Visual Analytics via Interactive Lexicon Building using Word Embedding, abstract: Central to many text analysis methods is the notion of a concept: a set of semantically related keywords characterizing a specific object, phenomenon, or theme. Advances in word embedding allow building a concept from a small set of seed terms. However, naive application of such techniques may result in false positive errors because of the polysemy of natural language. To mitigate this problem, we present a visual analytics system called ConceptVector that guides a user in building such concepts and then using them to analyze documents. Document-analysis case studies with real-world datasets demonstrate the fine-grained analysis provided by ConceptVector. To support the elaborate modeling of concepts, we introduce a bipolar concept model and support for specifying irrelevant words. We validate the interactive lexicon building interface by a user study and expert reviews. Quantitative evaluation shows that the bipolar lexicon generated with our methods is comparable to human-generated ones., authors: [{'name': 'Deokgun Park', 'affiliation': 'University of Maryland in College Park, MD, USA'}, {'name': 'Seungyeon Kim', 'affiliation': 'Google Inc. in Mountain View, CA, USA'}, {'name': 'Jurim Lee', 'affiliation': 'Korea University in Seoul, Republic of Korea'}, {'name': 'Jaegul Choo', 'affiliation': 'Korea University in Seoul, Republic of Korea'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Diakopoulos', 'affiliation': 'Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, USA'}, {'name': 'Niklas Elmqvist', 'affiliation': 'University of Maryland in College Park, MD, USA'}], publicationVenue: IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS, publicationDate: January 2018, keywords: ['Text analytics', 'Visual analytics', 'Word embedding', 'Text summarization', 'Text classification', 'Concepts'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the theory that semantically related keywords can effectively characterize concepts for text analysis.

TextLuas: Tracking and Visualizing Document and Term Clusters in Dynamic Text Data, abstract: For large volumes of text data collected over time, a key knowledge discovery task is identifying and tracking clusters. These clusters may correspond to emerging themes, popular topics, or breaking news stories in a corpus. This paper proposes a model for tracking dynamic clusters characterized by the evolutionary events of each cluster and introduces the TextLuas system for tracking these dynamic clusters and visualizing their evolution using a metro map metaphor., authors: [{'name': 'Derek Greene', 'affiliation': 'Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin, Ireland'}, {'name': 'Daniel Archambault', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, Swansea University, UK'}, {'name': 'Václav Belák', 'affiliation': 'Insight Centre for Data Analytics, NUI Galway, Ireland'}, {'name': 'Pádraig Cunningham', 'affiliation': 'Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Dublin, Ireland'}], publicationVenue: arXiv, publicationDate: 2014-11-03, keywords: ['Dynamic text data', 'Cluster tracking', 'Visualization', 'Metro map metaphor', 'Tag cloud'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the problem of clustering dynamic data and the need for interactive exploration of the output of these analysis techniques, particularly in cases where researchers wish to simultaneously explore both the change in cluster structure over time and the change in the textual content associated with clusters., mainPoints: ['Introduction of a model for tracking dynamic clusters in text data.', 'Development of the TextLuas system for visualizing the evolution of these clusters.', 'Adaptation of the tag cloud representation to dynamic clustering scenarios.', ""Demonstration of the system's application on two different text corpora.""], results: The TextLuas system elucidates the evolution of key themes in the analyzed text corpora and provides insights into bibliographic network research through the application of the system., applications: ['Interactive exploration of dynamic text data sets for knowledge discovery.', 'Analysis of evolving themes and topics in large volumes of text data over time.', 'Application to bibliographic network research for exploring the evolution of scientific communities.'], additionalInformation: ['The system illustrates the relationship between dynamic clusters using a metro map-style layout.', 'The content contained in these clusters is presented in the form of aggregated tag clouds.', 'Future work may explore dynamic cluster aggregation or filtering for highly volatile data.'], methodology.dataCollection: Analysis of two text corpora, including economic news sources and a Web 2.0 social bookmarking portal., methodology.dataAnalysis: Employment of a heuristic threshold-based matching method for tracking clusters across time steps, and a dynamic spectral co-clustering algorithm for clustering individual time step graphs."

iVisClustering: An Interactive Visual Document Clustering via Topic Modeling, abstract: Clustering plays an important role in many large-scale data analyses providing users with an overall understanding of their data. Nonetheless, clustering is not an easy task due to noisy features and outliers existing in the data, and thus the clustering results obtained from automatic algorithms often do not make clear sense. To remedy this problem, automatic clustering should be complemented with interactive visualization strategies. This paper proposes an interactive visual analytics system for document clustering, called iVisClustering, based on a widely-used topic modeling method, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). iVisClustering provides a summary of each cluster in terms of its most representative keywords and visualizes soft clustering results in parallel coordinates. The main view of the system provides a 2D plot that visualizes cluster similarities and the relation among data items with a graph-based representation., authors: [{'name': 'Hanseung Lee', 'affiliation': 'Georgia Institute of Technology, USA'}, {'name': 'Jaeyeon Kihm', 'affiliation': 'Cornell University, USA'}, {'name': 'Jaegul Choo', 'affiliation': 'Georgia Institute of Technology, USA'}, {'name': 'John Stasko', 'affiliation': 'Georgia Institute of Technology, USA'}, {'name': 'Haesun Park', 'affiliation': 'Georgia Institute of Technology, USA'}], publicationVenue: Eurographics Conference on Visualization (EuroVis) 2012, publicationDate: 2012, keywords: ['Clustering', 'Visual Analytics', 'Document Clustering', 'Topic Modeling', 'Latent Dirichlet Allocation', 'Interactive Visualization'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the challenges of clustering large-scale data and the limitations of automatic clustering algorithms.

Assisting Users with Clustering Tasks by Combining Metric Learning and Classification, abstract: Interactive clustering refers to situations in which a human labeler assists a learning algorithm in automatically clustering items. This paper presents assisted clustering, where a user creates explicit groups of items from a large set and seeks suggestions on what items to add to each group. The research explores combining metric learning and classification to assist users in clustering tasks, showing that a hybrid mechanism often exceeds the performance of using either method alone., authors: [{'name': 'Sumit Basu', 'affiliation': 'Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA'}, {'name': 'Danyel Fisher', 'affiliation': 'Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA'}, {'name': 'Steven M.

It explores how these methods can be combined to assist users in clustering tasks more effectively., mainPoints: ['Introduction of assisted clustering, a variant of interactive clustering where users seek suggestions for adding items to groups.', 'Exploration of metric learning and classification as methods to assist in clustering tasks.', 'Development of a hybrid mechanism that combines metric learning and classification, showing improved performance over using either method alone.', 'Presentation of results from trials based on human clusterings, demonstrating the effectiveness of the hybrid approach.'], results: The hybrid mechanism matches and often substantially exceeds the performance of systems that exclusively use either metric learning or classification. The method performs well in both 'cold start' and 'warm start' conditions, with significant improvements in the latter., applications: ['Enhancing interactive clustering systems by providing more effective suggestions for users organizing items into groups.', 'Applicable to various types of data that can be represented visually and for which similarity metrics can be defined.'], additionalInformation: [""The study's formulation is based on users' observed behavior, highlighting the relevance of both classifiers and metric learners in assisted clustering."", ""The hybrid method's adaptability suggests potential applicability in other scenarios where both types of learners are relevant."", 'Future work could explore incorporating more sophisticated individual learners to further improve the overall system performance.'], methodology.dataCollection: Observational study to understand human sorting behavior and development of an interactive system for assisted clustering to collect ground truth data., methodology.dataAnalysis: Experimentation with both metric learning and classification approaches, followed by the development and evaluation of a hybrid mechanism combining both approaches."

Helping Users Sort Faster with Adaptive Machine Learning Recommendations, abstract: Sorting and clustering large numbers of documents can be an overwhelming task: manual solutions tend to be slow, while machine learning systems often present results that don’t align well with users’ intents. We created and evaluated a system for helping users sort large numbers of documents into clusters. iCluster has the capability to recommend new items for existing clusters and appropriate clusters for items. The recommendations are based on a learning model that adapts over time – as the user adds more items to a cluster, the system’s model improves and the recommendations become more relevant. Thirty-two subjects used iCluster to sort hundreds of data items both with and without recommendations; we found that recommendations allow users to sort items more rapidly. A pool of 161 raters then assessed the quality of the resulting clusters, finding that clusters generated with recommendations were of statistically indistinguishable quality. Both the manual and assisted methods were substantially better than a fully automatic method., authors: [{'name': 'Steven M.

Observation-Level Interaction with Statistical Models for Visual Analytics, abstract: In visual analytics, sensemaking is facilitated through interactive visual exploration of data. This paper explores how models for visual analytic tools can be designed to allow users to express their reasoning on observations (the data), instead of directly on the model or tunable parameters. It introduces observation-level interactions within the context of three statistical methods: Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM), discussing their importance in the sensemaking process., authors: [{'name': 'Alex Endert', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech'}, {'name': 'Chao Han', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics, Virginia Tech'}, {'name': 'Dipayan Maiti', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics, Virginia Tech'}, {'name': 'Leanna House', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics, Virginia Tech'}, {'name': 'Scotland Leman', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics, Virginia Tech'}, {'name': 'Chris North', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech'}], publicationVenue: IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology, publicationDate: October 23 - 28, Providence, RI, USA, 2011, keywords: ['observation-level interaction', 'visual analytics', 'statistical models'], theoreticalFramework: The paper postulates that sensemaking in visual analytics is not focused on parameter adjustments but on perceived connections and patterns within the data. It introduces a framework for integrating user interaction at the observation level with statistical models to facilitate this process., mainPoints: ['Sensemaking in visual analytics is enhanced by focusing on observation-level interactions rather than parameter adjustments.', 'Exploratory and expressive interactions are crucial for integrating user intuition into the sensemaking process.', 'Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) can be modified to support observation-level interactions.', 'The paper presents use cases for each statistical method, demonstrating how observation-level interaction can be incorporated into visual analytic tools.'], results: The paper demonstrates that incorporating observation-level interactions into PPCA, MDS, and GTM allows users to more effectively engage in the sensemaking process by leveraging their domain knowledge and intuition directly within the visual analytic tools., applications: ['Enhanced visual analytics tools that support direct user interaction with data points for sensemaking.', 'Improved understanding and insight generation from complex datasets in various domains through interactive visual exploration.'], additionalInformation: ['The study highlights the importance of designing visual analytic tools that support observation-level interaction to facilitate sensemaking.', 'Future research directions include integrating these modified statistical models into fully functional visual analytics tools and evaluating their effectiveness through user studies.', 'The paper contributes to the field by proposing a novel approach to interaction in visual analytics, focusing on data points rather than model parameters.'], methodology.dataCollection: Use cases for GTM, MDS, and PPCA, illustrating observation-level interaction in various contexts., methodology.dataAnalysis: Modification of statistical models to incorporate user interactions directly with the data points in a visualization, and subsequent analysis of the impact on the models' outputs."

ReGroup: Interactive Machine Learning for On-Demand Group Creation in Social Networks, abstract: ReGroup is an interactive machine learning system designed to assist users in creating custom, on-demand groups within online social networks. By learning from the user's actions of adding members to a group, ReGroup iteratively develops a probabilistic model of group membership, which is then used to suggest additional members and group characteristics for filtering. The evaluation demonstrates ReGroup's effectiveness in facilitating the creation of large and varied groups, highlighting its potential to enhance in-context sharing and promote better online privacy practices., authors: [{'name': 'Saleema Amershi', 'affiliation': 'Computer Science & Engineering, DUB Group, University of Washington'}, {'name': 'James Fogarty', 'affiliation': 'Computer Science & Engineering, DUB Group, University of Washington'}, {'name': 'Daniel S.

Dis-Function: Learning Distance Functions Interactively, abstract: The paper presents a system that allows experts to interact directly with a visual representation of their data to define an appropriate distance function, thus avoiding direct manipulation of obtuse model parameters. Through iterative interaction and optimization, users can achieve a scatterplot view and its corresponding distance function that reflects their knowledge of the data. The system's scalability in data size and dimension is evaluated, showing computational efficiency and interactive or near-interactive user experience., authors: [{'name': 'Eli T.

Podium: Ranking Data Using Mixed-Initiative Visual Analytics, abstract: People often rank and order data points as a vital part of making decisions. Multi-attribute ranking systems are a common tool used to make these data-driven decisions. However, these systems assume that users are able to quantify their conceptual understanding of how important particular attributes are to a decision, which is not always easy or even possible for users to do. To address these challenges, we present a visual analytic application to help people rank multi-variate data points. We developed a prototype system, Podium, that allows users to drag rows in the table to rank order data points based on their perception of the relative value of the data. Podium then infers a weighting model using Ranking SVM that satisfies the user’s data preferences as closely as possible., authors: [{'name': 'Emily Wall', 'affiliation': 'Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA'}, {'name': 'Subhajit Das', 'affiliation': 'Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA'}, {'name': 'Ravish Chawla', 'affiliation': 'Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA'}, {'name': 'Bharath Kalidindi', 'affiliation': 'Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA'}, {'name': 'Eli T.

Bridging the Gap between User Intention and Model Parameters for Human-in-the-Loop Data Analytics, abstract: Exploratory data analysis is challenging given the complexity of data. Models find structure in the data lessening the complexity for users. These models have parameters that can be adjusted to explore the data from many different angles providing more ways to learn about the data. “Human in the loop” means users can interact with the parameters to explore alternative structures. This exploration allows for discovery. This paper examines usability issues of Human-Model Interaction (HMI) for data analytics.

Big Text Visual Analytics in Sensemaking, abstract: Learning from text data often involves a loop of tasks that iterate between foraging for information and synthesizing it in incremental hypotheses. This paper addresses the challenge of using spatial workspaces for synthesizing information from large document collections, particularly when only a small subset are relevant. The multi-model semantic interaction (MSI) technique is applied, leveraging user interactions to aid in display layout, forage for new, relevant documents as implied by the interactions, and place them in context of the user’s existing spatial layout., authors: [{'name': 'Lauren Bradel', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech'}, {'name': 'Nathan Wycoff', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech'}, {'name': 'Leanna House', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics, Virginia Tech'}, {'name': 'Chris North', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech'}], publicationVenue: IEEE, publicationDate: 2015, keywords: ['sensemaking', 'interaction design', 'visual analytics'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the theory of sensemaking in large text data analytics, emphasizing the importance of spatial workspaces and semantic interaction for information synthesis., mainPoints: ['Spatial workspaces facilitate the synthesis of information from large text datasets.', 'The multi-model semantic interaction technique leverages user interactions for layout adjustments, document foraging, and contextual placement.', 'Semantic interaction embeds visual analytics of big text collections directly into the human sensemaking process.'], results: The application of multi-model semantic interaction enables effective sensemaking in large text datasets by integrating information retrieval with information synthesis in a spatial workspace, demonstrating the system's capability through use cases like literature review and investigative journalism., applications: ['Literature review in academic research.', 'Investigative journalism for exploring current events and news topics.'], additionalInformation: ['The system faces limitations in parsing all documents at once and integrating with external information retrieval algorithms.', 'Future work includes improving the retrieval and parsing process, exploring additional recommender systems, and extending the system to cache potential results for future relevance.', 'This research contributes to the field by demonstrating the practical application of semantic interaction in real-world exploratory data analysis tasks.'], methodology.dataCollection: The study uses large document collections such as scientific literature, news, and web data as the basis for analysis., methodology.dataAnalysis: Semantic interaction techniques are applied to interpret user interactions for data layout, relevance filtering, and similarity-based spatial arrangement."

Observation-Level Interaction with Clustering and Dimension Reduction Algorithms, abstract: This paper introduces a model for Observation-Level Interaction (OLI) that integrates clustering within data projections to enhance sensemaking in visual analytics. By allowing users to interactively manipulate data points and clusters in a visualization, the model provides a cooperative framework where user actions inform the underlying mathematical model, affecting both the data layout and cluster formations. This approach addresses the OLI 'with respect to what' problem by using clusters as interaction targets, thereby refining the feedback loop between user intentions and the visualization layout., authors: [{'name': 'John Wenskovitch', 'affiliation': 'Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA'}, {'name': 'Chris North', 'affiliation': 'Discovery Analytics Center, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA'}], publicationVenue: HILDA '17 Chicago, Illinois, USA, publicationDate: 2017, keywords: ['Observation-Level Interaction (OLI)', 'sensemaking', 'data clustering', 'semantic interaction', 'visual analytics'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the concept of Observation-Level Interaction (OLI), which emphasizes the role of interactive semantic exploration in sensemaking processes. The framework integrates clustering and dimension reduction techniques to enhance user interaction with multidimensional data projections., mainPoints: ['Introduction of a model that integrates clustering within data projections for enhanced sensemaking.', 'Proposal of a cooperative framework where user interactions with data points and clusters inform the underlying mathematical model.', ""Addressing the OLI 'with respect to what' problem by using clusters as explicit targets for interaction."", 'Evaluation of the model through a case study involving a dataset of animal characteristics.'], results: The model successfully learns from user interactions, affecting the layout of nodes and clusters not directly interacted with by the user. The case study demonstrates the model's ability to adapt to user intentions, refining the visualization to better reflect user-defined relationships among data points., applications: ['Enhancing visual analytics tools with interactive clustering and dimension reduction capabilities.', 'Improving sensemaking in complex data exploration tasks by providing a more intuitive interaction model.'], additionalInformation: ['The system initializes with predetermined cluster settings, which may introduce bias in user exploration.', 'Future work includes exploring high-dimensional space clustering before projection, supporting cluster-level interactions, and updating the backend model for true layout model inversion.', 'The research highlights the importance of integrating user feedback into the visualization process for more meaningful data exploration.'], methodology.dataCollection: Use of a dataset containing 49 animals defined by 85 numeric attributes for the case study., methodology.dataAnalysis: Application of Euclidean distance function, force-directed layout, and k-means clustering to project and cluster the data.

Andromeda: Observation-Level and Parametric Interaction for Exploratory Data Analysis, abstract: Exploring high-dimensional data is challenging. As the number of dimensions in datasets increases, it becomes harder to discover patterns and develop insights. Dimension reduction algorithms, such as multidimensional scaling, support data explorations by reducing datasets to two dimensions for visualization. Because these algorithms rely on underlying parameterizations, they may be tweaked to assess the data from multiple perspectives. Alas, tweaking can be difficult for users without a strong knowledge base of the underlying algorithms. We present Andromeda, an interactive visual analytics tool we developed to enable non-experts of statistical models to explore domain-specific, high-dimensional data. This application implements interactive weighted multidimensional scaling (WMDS) and allows for both parametric and observation-level interaction to provide in-depth data exploration., authors: [{'name': 'Jessica Zeitz Self', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA'}, {'name': 'Leanna House', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA'}, {'name': 'Scotland Leman', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA'}, {'name': 'Chris North', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA'}], publicationVenue: Not specified, publicationDate: Not specified, keywords: ['Evaluation', 'user interface', 'dimension reduction', 'usability'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the challenges of exploring high-dimensional data and the utility of dimension reduction algorithms like weighted multidimensional scaling (WMDS) for visualization and data exploration., mainPoints: ['High-dimensional data exploration is challenging and essential for discovering patterns and insights.', 'Dimension reduction algorithms facilitate data exploration by reducing datasets to two dimensions for visualization.', 'Andromeda is an interactive visual analytics tool designed for non-experts to explore high-dimensional data using WMDS.', 'Andromeda supports both parametric interaction and observation-level interaction, enhancing data exploration capabilities.', 'A controlled usability study was conducted to assess Andromeda and compare the effectiveness of parametric interaction, observation-level interaction, and their combination.'], results: Participants were able to effectively use Andromeda for data exploration, regardless of the interaction type provided.

Casting Multiple Shadows: High-Dimensional Interactive Data Visualisation with Tours and Embeddings, abstract: Non-linear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) methods such as t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) are ubiquitous in the natural sciences, however, the appropriate use of these methods is difficult because of their complex parameterisations; analysts must make trade-offs in order to identify structure in the visualisation of an NLDR technique. We present visual diagnostics for the pragmatic usage of NLDR methods by combining them with a technique called the tour. A tour is a sequence of interpolated linear projections of multivariate data onto a lower dimensional space. The sequence is displayed as a dynamic visualisation, allowing a user to see the shadows the high-dimensional data casts in a lower dimensional view. By linking the tour to an NLDR view, we can preserve global structure and through user interactions like linked brushing observe where the NLDR view may be misleading., authors: [{'name': 'Stuart Lee', 'affiliation': 'Monash University'}, {'name': 'Ursula Laa', 'affiliation': 'Monash University'}, {'name': 'Dianne Cook', 'affiliation': 'Monash University'}], publicationVenue: Journal of Data Science, Statistics, and Visualisation, publicationDate: December 2020, keywords: ['dimensionality reduction', 'high-dimensional data', 'interactive graphics', 't-SNE', 'grand tour', 'R'], theoreticalFramework: The paper is grounded in the theory of dimensionality reduction, particularly focusing on non-linear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) methods and the concept of the tour for high-dimensional data visualization., mainPoints: ['NLDR methods are widely used but challenging due to complex parameterizations.', 'The tour technique offers a dynamic visualization of high-dimensional data in lower dimensions.', 'Combining NLDR methods with tours can help preserve global structure and identify misleading aspects of NLDR visualizations.', 'The implementation of this framework is available as an R package called liminal.'], results: The approach is shown to be useful for cluster orientation tasks and helps in identifying distortions and diffusions in NLDR visualizations, making it easier for analysts to interpret high-dimensional data., applications: ['Enhancing the interpretability of NLDR visualizations in natural sciences.', 'Assisting in cluster orientation tasks in data analysis workflows.', 'Providing a pragmatic workflow for incorporating interactive graphics and tours with embeddings.'], additionalInformation: ['The framework is implemented in an R package called liminal, available on GitHub.', 'The study highlights the importance of visual diagnostics in the use of NLDR methods.', 'Future research directions could include exploring one to many linked brushing for investigating neighbourhood preservation and developing better displays and sub-sampling strategies for large datasets.'], methodology.dataCollection: The study uses both simulated datasets and real-world single cell transcriptomics data to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework., methodology.dataAnalysis: The analysis involves combining NLDR methods with the tour technique, using interactive graphics for data visualization, and employing case studies to illustrate the utility of the approach."

Bridging cognitive gaps between user and model in interactive dimension reduction, abstract: Interactive machine learning (ML) systems are difficult to design because of the ‘Two Black Boxes’ problem that exists at the interface between human and machine. This paper identifies several cognitive gaps in a previously-developed interactive visual analytics (VA) system, Andromeda, and aims to bridge these gaps by making usability improvements. The improvements include designing new visual features and improving the underlying algorithm to better implement user intent during data exploration.

Visualizing Hidden Themes of Taxi Movement with Semantic Transformation, abstract: A new methodology is developed to discover and analyze the hidden knowledge of massive taxi trajectory data within a city. This approach creatively transforms the geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) to street names reflecting contextual semantic information, enabling semantic analysis of massive taxi data sets as document corpora. Hidden themes, namely taxi topics, are identified through textual topic modeling techniques and visualized through a visual analytics system integrating interactive visualization tools., authors: [{'name': 'Ding Chu', 'affiliation': 'Kent State University'}, {'name': 'David A.

SemVis: Semantic Visualization for Interactive Topical Analysis, abstract: Exploratory analysis of a text corpus is an important task that can be aided by informative visualization. Semantic visualization infuses the visualization space with latent semantics by incorporating a topic model, allowing users to perceive relationships between documents and topics spatially. This paper illustrates how a semantic visualization system called SemVis could be used to navigate a text corpus interactively and topically via browsing and searching., authors: [{'name': 'Tuan M. V. Le', 'affiliation': 'Singapore Management University, 80 Stamford Road, Singapore 178902'}, {'name': 'Hady W. Lauw', 'affiliation': 'Singapore Management University, 80 Stamford Road, Singapore 178902'}], publicationVenue: CIKM’17, November 6–10, 2017, Singapore, publicationDate: 2017, keywords: ['Semantic visualization', 'topic model', 'interactive topical analysis'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the concept of semantic visualization, which integrates topic modeling with spatial visualization techniques to represent text corpora. It leverages the idea that spatial proximity in the visualization can reflect semantic closeness, enhancing the exploratory analysis of text data., mainPoints: ['Introduction of SemVis, a semantic visualization system for interactive topical analysis.', 'Discussion on the importance of semantic visualization in understanding text corpora.', 'Illustration of how SemVis enables browsing and searching of a text corpus through a spatially-oriented interface.', 'Presentation of a pilot user study confirming the effectiveness of SemVis in aiding users to perceive document similarities and topics.'], results: The pilot user study showed that semantic visualization, as implemented in SemVis, helps users achieve better precision, recall, and F1 scores in identifying documents related to specific topics, compared to traditional scatterplot visualizations generated from t-SNE., applications: ['Interactive exploration and analysis of text corpora for various professional scenarios, such as literature review and legal research.', 'Enhanced understanding of text data through spatially-oriented visualization, facilitating the discovery of document similarities and topic distributions.'], additionalInformation: ['SemVis is the first demonstrable semantic visualization system, setting a precedent for future research and development in the field.', 'The study highlights the importance of incorporating topic information (colors and representative words) in the visualization to aid user comprehension.', 'Future research directions include exploring other datasets, refining the visualization techniques, and further user studies to validate the effectiveness of semantic visualization in various contexts.'], methodology.dataCollection: The methodology involves using existing text corpora, such as the 20News dataset, for demonstration and evaluation purposes., methodology.dataAnalysis: Semantic visualization techniques, specifically the Semafore model, are used to jointly model topics and visualization coordinates.

Semantic Interaction for Visual Text Analytics, abstract: Visual analytics emphasizes sensemaking of large, complex datasets through interactively exploring visualizations generated by statistical models. This paper presents the concept of semantic interaction, enabling analysts to interact with models directly within the visual metaphor using interactions that derive from their analytic process, such as searching, highlighting, annotating, and repositioning documents. The implementation of semantic interactions using machine learning techniques in a visual analytic tool, ForceSPIRE, for interactive analysis of textual data within a spatial visualization is demonstrated., authors: [{'name': 'Alex Endert', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA USA'}, {'name': 'Patrick Fiaux', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA USA'}, {'name': 'Chris North', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA USA'}], publicationVenue: CHI 2012, publicationDate: May 5–10, 2012, keywords: ['Visualization', 'visual analytics', 'interaction'], theoreticalFramework: The paper is grounded in the theoretical framework of visual analytics, emphasizing the integration of human intuition with statistical models and visualization for sensemaking in large, complex datasets.

Interpretive Impacts of Text Visualization: Mitigating Political Framing Effects, abstract: This article explores how text visualization can influence the impacts that framing has on the perception of political issues. It demonstrates that exposure to a text visualization can mitigate framing effects and shows a transfer effect, where participants who saw the visualization remained uninfluenced by framing in subsequent texts, even when the visualization was absent., authors: [{'name': 'Eric P.

AI4VIS: Survey on Artificial Intelligence Approaches for Data Visualization, abstract: Visualizations themselves have become a data format. Akin to other data formats such as text and images, visualizations are increasingly created, stored, shared, and (re-)used with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In this survey, we probe the underlying vision of formalizing visualizations as an emerging data format and review the recent advance in applying AI techniques to visualization data (AI4VIS). We define visualization data as the digital representations of visualizations in computers and focus on data visualization (e.g., charts and infographics). We build our survey upon a corpus spanning ten different fields in computer science with an eye toward identifying important common interests. Our resulting taxonomy is organized around WHAT is visualization data and its representation, WHY and HOW to apply AI to visualization data., authors: [{'name': 'Aoyu Wu', 'affiliation': 'Hong Kong University of Science and Technology'}, {'name': 'Yun Wang', 'affiliation': 'Microsoft Research Asia'}, {'name': 'Xinhuan Shu', 'affiliation': 'Hong Kong University of Science and Technology'}, {'name': 'Dominik Moritz', 'affiliation': 'Carnegie Mellon University and Apple'}, {'name': 'Weiwei Cui', 'affiliation': 'Microsoft Research Asia'}, {'name': 'Haidong Zhang', 'affiliation': 'Microsoft Research Asia'}, {'name': 'Dongmei Zhang', 'affiliation': 'Microsoft Research Asia'}, {'name': 'Huamin Qu', 'affiliation': 'Hong Kong University of Science and Technology'}], publicationVenue: IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, publicationDate: December 2022, keywords: ['Survey', 'data visualization', 'artificial intelligence', 'data format', 'machine learning'], theoreticalFramework: The research is guided by the vision of formalizing visualizations as a new data format and explores the application of AI techniques in managing and exploiting visualization data., mainPoints: ['Visualizations are becoming a new data format processed by AI.', 'A taxonomy is developed to categorize AI4VIS research into what, why, and how perspectives.', 'Common tasks applied to visualization data are identified and discussed.', 'Research opportunities in managing and exploiting visualization data with AI support are outlined.'], results: The survey synthesizes the current landscape of AI4VIS research, identifying common tasks and techniques across disciplines.

TexTonic: Interactive visualization for exploration and discovery of very large text collections, abstract: TexTonic is a visual analytic system for interactive exploration of very large unstructured text collections. It visualizes hierarchical clusters of representative terms, snippets, and documents in a single, multi-scale spatial layout. Exploration is supported by interacting with the visualization and directly manipulating the terms in the visualization using semantic interactions. These semantic interactions steer the underlying analytic model by translating user interactions within the visualization to contextual updates to the supporting data model. The combination of semantic interactions and information visualization at multiple levels of the data hierarchy helps users manage information overload so that they can more effectively explore very large text collections., authors: [{'name': 'Celeste Lyn Paul', 'affiliation': 'US Department of Defense, Laurel, MD, USA'}, {'name': 'Jessica Chang', 'affiliation': 'US Department of Defense, Laurel, MD, USA'}, {'name': 'Alex Endert', 'affiliation': 'Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA'}, {'name': 'Nick Cramer', 'affiliation': 'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA'}, {'name': 'David Gillen', 'affiliation': 'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA'}, {'name': 'Shawn Hampton', 'affiliation': 'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA'}, {'name': 'Russ Burtner', 'affiliation': 'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA'}, {'name': 'Ralph Perko', 'affiliation': 'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA'}, {'name': 'Kristin A Cook', 'affiliation': 'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA'}], publicationVenue: Information Visualization, publicationDate: 2018, keywords: ['Text and document visualization', 'interactive visual analysis', 'geospatial visualization', 'adaptive user interfaces', 'user study'], theoreticalFramework: The research is grounded in the principles of visual analytics, emphasizing the importance of user interaction with visualized data to support sensemaking and analysis, particularly for large data sets that are difficult to understand using conventional methods., mainPoints: ['Introduction of TexTonic, a system designed for the exploration of large unstructured text collections through user-driven analytics.', 'Description of TexTonic’s data processing and analytic pipeline, user interface, and interaction design principles.', ""Presentation of a user study conducted with experienced data analysts to evaluate the system's usability and effectiveness."", 'Discussion on the implications of TexTonic for visual exploration and discovery tasks.'], results: The user study indicated that TexTonic was effective in supporting users to manage information overload and explore large text collections intuitively.
